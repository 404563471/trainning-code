    "\nParts of a Figure\n=================\n\nNow, let's have a deeper look at the components of a Matplotlib figure.\n\n![](../../_static/anatomy.png)\n\n\n:class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`\n----------------------------------\n\nThe **whole** figure.  The figure keeps\ntrack of all the child :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, a smattering of\n'special' artists (titles, figure legends, etc), and the **canvas**.\n(Don't worry too much about the canvas, it is crucial as it is the\nobject that actually does the drawing to get you your plot, but as the\nuser it is more-or-less invisible to you).  A figure can contain any\nnumber of :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, but will typically have\nat least one.\n\nThe easiest way to create a new figure is with pyplot::\n\n   fig = plt.figure()  # an empty figure with no Axes\n   fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # a figure with a single Axes\n   fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)  # a figure with a 2x2 grid of Axes\n\nIt's convenient to create the axes together with the figure, but you can\nalso add axes later on, allowing for more complex axes layouts.\n\n:class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`\n------------------------------\n\nThis is what you think of as 'a plot', it is the region of the image\nwith the data space. A given figure\ncan contain many Axes, but a given :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`\nobject can only be in one :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`.  The\nAxes contains two (or three in the case of 3D)\n:class:`~matplotlib.axis.Axis` objects (be aware of the difference\nbetween **Axes** and **Axis**) which take care of the data limits (the\ndata limits can also be controlled via the :meth:`.axes.Axes.set_xlim` and\n:meth:`.axes.Axes.set_ylim` methods).  Each :class:`~.axes.Axes` has a title\n(set via :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_title`), an x-label (set via\n:meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlabel`), and a y-label set via\n:meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_ylabel`).\n\nThe :class:`~.axes.Axes` class and its member functions are the primary entry\npoint to working with the OO interface.\n\n:class:`~matplotlib.axis.Axis`\n------------------------------\n\nThese are the number-line-like objects. They take\ncare of setting the graph limits and generating the ticks (the marks\non the axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks).  The location of\nthe ticks is determined by a `~matplotlib.ticker.Locator` object and the\nticklabel strings are formatted by a `~matplotlib.ticker.Formatter`.  The\ncombination of the correct `.Locator` and `.Formatter` gives very fine\ncontrol over the tick locations and labels.\n\n:class:`~matplotlib.artist.Artist`\n----------------------------------\n\nBasically everything you can see on the figure is an artist (even the\n`.Figure`, `Axes <.axes.Axes>`, and `~.axis.Axis` objects).  This includes\n`.Text` objects, `.Line2D` objects, :mod:`.collections` objects, `.Patch`\nobjects ... (you get the idea).  When the figure is rendered, all of the\nartists are drawn to the **canvas**.  Most Artists are tied to an Axes; such\nan Artist cannot be shared by multiple Axes, or moved from one to another.\n\n\nTypes of inputs to plotting functions\n=====================================\n\nAll of plotting functions expect `numpy.array` or `numpy.ma.masked_array` as\ninput.  Classes that are 'array-like' such as `pandas` data objects\nand `numpy.matrix` may or may not work as intended.  It is best to\nconvert these to `numpy.array` objects prior to plotting.\n\nFor example, to convert a `pandas.DataFrame` ::\n\n  a = pandas.DataFrame(np.random.rand(4,5), columns = list('abcde'))\n  a_asarray = a.values\n\nand to convert a `numpy.matrix` ::\n\n  b = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n  b_asarray = np.asarray(b)\n\n\nThe object-oriented interface and the pyplot interface\n======================================================\n\nAs noted above, there are essentially two ways to use Matplotlib:\n\n- Explicitly create figures and axes, and call methods on them (the\n  \"object-oriented (OO) style\").\n- Rely on pyplot to automatically create and manage the figures and axes, and\n  use pyplot functions for plotting.\n\nSo one can do (OO-style)\n\n"

    "For these simple examples this style seems like overkill, however\nonce the graphs get slightly more complex it pays off.\n\n\n\nBackends\n========\n\n\nWhat is a backend?\n------------------\n\nA lot of documentation on the website and in the mailing lists refers\nto the \"backend\" and many new users are confused by this term.\nmatplotlib targets many different use cases and output formats.  Some\npeople use matplotlib interactively from the python shell and have\nplotting windows pop up when they type commands.  Some people run\n`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ notebooks and draw inline plots for\nquick data analysis. Others embed matplotlib into graphical user\ninterfaces like wxpython or pygtk to build rich applications.  Some\npeople use matplotlib in batch scripts to generate postscript images\nfrom numerical simulations, and still others run web application\nservers to dynamically serve up graphs.\n\nTo support all of these use cases, matplotlib can target different\noutputs, and each of these capabilities is called a backend; the\n\"frontend\" is the user facing code, i.e., the plotting code, whereas the\n\"backend\" does all the hard work behind-the-scenes to make the figure.\nThere are two types of backends: user interface backends (for use in\npygtk, wxpython, tkinter, qt4, or macosx; also referred to as\n\"interactive backends\") and hardcopy backends to make image files\n(PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as \"non-interactive backends\").\n\nSelecting a backend\n-------------------\n\nThere are three ways to configure your backend:\n\n1. The :rc:`backend` parameter in your ``matplotlibrc`` file\n2. The :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment variable\n3. The function :func:`matplotlib.use`\n\nA more detailed description is given below.\n\nIf multiple of these are configurations are present, the last one from the\nlist takes precedence; e.g. calling :func:`matplotlib.use()` will override\nthe setting in your ``matplotlibrc``.\n\nIf no backend is explicitly set, Matplotlib automatically detects a usable\nbackend based on what is available on your system and on whether a GUI event\nloop is already running. On Linux, if the environment variable\n:envvar:`DISPLAY` is unset, the \"event loop\" is identified as \"headless\",\nwhich causes a fallback to a noninteractive backend (agg).\n\nHere is a detailed description of the configuration methods:\n\n#. Setting :rc:`backend` in your ``matplotlibrc`` file::\n\n       backend : qt5agg   # use pyqt5 with antigrain (agg) rendering\n\n   See also :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`.\n\n#. Setting the :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment variable:\n\n   You can set the environment variable either for your current shell or for\n   a single script.\n\n   On Unix::\n\n        > export MPLBACKEND=qt5agg\n        > python simple_plot.py\n\n        > MPLBACKEND=qt5agg python simple_plot.py\n\n   On Windows, only the former is possible::\n\n        > set MPLBACKEND=qt5agg\n        > python simple_plot.py\n\n   Setting this environment variable will override the ``backend`` parameter\n   in *any* ``matplotlibrc``, even if there is a ``matplotlibrc`` in your\n   current working directory. Therefore, setting :envvar:`MPLBACKEND`\n   globally, e.g. in your ``.bashrc`` or ``.profile``, is discouraged as it\n   might lead to counter-intuitive behavior.\n\n#. If your script depends on a specific backend you can use the function\n   :func:`matplotlib.use`::\n\n      import matplotlib\n      matplotlib.use('qt5agg')\n\n   This should be done before any figure is created; otherwise Matplotlib may\n   fail to switch the backend and raise an ImportError.\n\n   Using `~matplotlib.use` will require changes in your code if users want to\n   use a different backend.  Therefore, you should avoid explicitly calling\n   `~matplotlib.use` unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\nThe builtin backends\n--------------------\n\nBy default, Matplotlib should automatically select a default backend which\nallows both interactive work and plotting from scripts, with output to the\nscreen and/or to a file, so at least initially you will not need to worry\nabout the backend.  The most common exception is if your Python distribution\ncomes without :mod:`tkinter` and you have no other GUI toolkit installed;\nthis happens on certain Linux distributions, where you need to install a\nLinux package named ``python-tk`` (or similar).\n\nIf, however, you want to write graphical user interfaces, or a web\napplication server (`howto-webapp`), or need a better\nunderstanding of what is going on, read on. To make things a little\nmore customizable for graphical user interfaces, matplotlib separates\nthe concept of the renderer (the thing that actually does the drawing)\nfrom the canvas (the place where the drawing goes).  The canonical\nrenderer for user interfaces is ``Agg`` which uses the `Anti-Grain\nGeometry`_ C++ library to make a raster (pixel) image of the figure; it\nis used by the ``Qt5Agg``, ``Qt4Agg``, ``GTK3Agg``, ``wxAgg``, ``TkAgg``, and\n``macosx`` backends.  An alternative renderer is based on the Cairo library,\nused by ``Qt5Cairo``, ``Qt4Cairo``, etc.\n\nFor the rendering engines, one can also distinguish between `vector\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics>`_ or `raster\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics>`_ renderers.  Vector\ngraphics languages issue drawing commands like \"draw a line from this\npoint to this point\" and hence are scale free, and raster backends\ngenerate a pixel representation of the line whose accuracy depends on a\nDPI setting.\n\nHere is a summary of the matplotlib renderers (there is an eponymous\nbackend for each; these are *non-interactive backends*, capable of\nwriting to a file):\n\n========  =========  =======================================================\nRenderer  Filetypes  Description\n========  =========  =======================================================\nAGG       png        raster_ graphics -- high quality images using the\n                     `Anti-Grain Geometry`_ engine\nPS        ps,        vector_ graphics -- Postscript_ output\n          eps\nPDF       pdf        vector_ graphics -- `Portable Document Format`_\nSVG       svg        vector_ graphics -- `Scalable Vector Graphics`_\nCairo     png, ps,   raster_ or vector_ graphics -- using the Cairo_ library\n          pdf, svg\n========  =========  =======================================================\n\nTo save plots using the non-interactive backends, use the\n``matplotlib.pyplot.savefig('filename')`` method.\n\nTo save plots using the non-interactive backends, use the\n``matplotlib.pyplot.savefig('filename')`` method.\n\nAnd here are the user interfaces and renderer combinations supported;\nthese are *interactive backends*, capable of displaying to the screen\nand of using appropriate renderers from the table above to write to\na file:\n\n========= ================================================================\nBackend   Description\n========= ================================================================\nQt5Agg    Agg rendering in a :term:`Qt5` canvas (requires PyQt5_).

To install ipympl\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pip install ipympl\n   jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipympl\n\nor\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   conda install ipympl -c conda-forge\n\nSee `jupyter-matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/jupyter-matplotlib>`__\nfor more details.\n\nGTK and Cairo\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n``GTK3`` backends (*both* ``GTK3Agg`` and ``GTK3Cairo``) depend on Cairo\n(pycairo>=1.11.0 or cairocffi).\n\n\nHow do I select PyQt4 or PySide?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe :envvar:`QT_API` environment variable can be set to either ``pyqt`` or\n``pyside`` to use ``PyQt4`` or ``PySide``, respectively.\n\nSince the default value for the bindings to be used is ``PyQt4``, Matplotlib\nfirst tries to import it, if the import fails, it tries to import ``PySide``.\n\nUsing non-builtin backends\n--------------------------\nMore generally, any importable backend can be selected by using any of the\nmethods above. If ``name.of.the.backend`` is the module containing the\nbackend, use ``module://name.of.the.backend`` as the backend name, e.g.\n``matplotlib.use('module://name.of.the.backend')``.\n\n\n\nWhat is interactive mode?\n=========================\n\nUse of an interactive backend (see `what-is-a-backend`)\npermits--but does not by itself require or ensure--plotting\nto the screen.  Whether and when plotting to the screen occurs,\nand whether a script or shell session continues after a plot\nis drawn on the screen, depends on the functions and methods\nthat are called, and on a state variable that determines whether\nmatplotlib is in \"interactive mode\".  The default Boolean value is set\nby the :file:`matplotlibrc` file, and may be customized like any other\nconfiguration parameter (see :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`).  It\nmay also be set via :func:`matplotlib.interactive`, and its\nvalue may be queried via :func:`matplotlib.is_interactive`.  Turning\ninteractive mode on and off in the middle of a stream of plotting\ncommands, whether in a script or in a shell, is rarely needed\nand potentially confusing, so in the following we will assume all\nplotting is done with interactive mode either on or off.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Major changes related to interactivity, and in particular the\n   role and behavior of :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show`, were made in the\n   transition to matplotlib version 1.0, and bugs were fixed in\n   1.0.1.  Here we describe the version 1.0.1 behavior for the\n   primary interactive backends, with the partial exception of\n   *macosx*.</p></div>\n\nInteractive mode may also be turned on via :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.ion`,\nand turned off via :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.ioff`.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Interactive mode works with suitable backends in ipython and in\n   the ordinary python shell, but it does *not* work in the IDLE IDE.\n   If the default backend does not support interactivity, an interactive\n   backend can be explicitly activated using any of the methods discussed\n   in `What is a backend?`_.</p></div>\n\n\nInteractive example\n--------------------\n\nFrom an ordinary python prompt, or after invoking ipython with no options,\ntry this::\n\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    plt.ion()\n    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n\nThis will pop up a plot window. Your terminal prompt will remain active, so\nthat you can type additional commands such as::\n\n    plt.title(\"interactive test\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"index\")\n\nOn most interactive backends, the figure window will also be updated if you\nchange it via the object-oriented interface. E.g. get a reference to the\n`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance, and call a method of that instance::\n\n    ax = plt.gca()\n    ax.plot([3.1, 2.2])\n\nIf you are using certain backends (like ``macosx``), or an older version\nof matplotlib, you may not see the new line added to the plot immediately.\nIn this case, you need to explicitly call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw`\nin order to update the plot::\n\n    plt.draw()\n\n\nNon-interactive example\n-----------------------\n\nStart a fresh session as in the previous example, but now\nturn interactive mode off::\n\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    plt.ioff()\n    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n\nNothing happened--or at least nothing has shown up on the\nscreen (unless you are using *macosx* backend, which is\nanomalous).  To make the plot appear, you need to do this::\n\n    plt.show()\n\nNow you see the plot, but your terminal command line is\nunresponsive; the :func:`.pyplot.show()` command *blocks* the input\nof additional commands until you manually kill the plot\nwindow.\n\nWhat good is this--being forced to use a blocking function?\nSuppose you need a script that plots the contents of a file\nto the screen.  You want to look at that plot, and then end\nthe script.  Without some blocking command such as ``show()``, the\nscript would flash up the plot and then end immediately,\nleaving nothing on the screen.\n\nIn addition, non-interactive mode delays all drawing until\n``show()`` is called; this is more efficient than redrawing\nthe plot each time a line in the script adds a new feature.\n\nPrior to version 1.0, ``show()`` generally could not be called\nmore than once in a single script (although sometimes one\ncould get away with it); for version 1.0.1 and above, this\nrestriction is lifted, so one can write a script like this::\n\n    import numpy as np\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n    plt.ioff()\n    for i in range(3):\n        plt.plot(np.random.rand(10))\n        plt.show()\n\nwhich makes three plots, one at a time. I.e. the second plot will show up,\nonce the first plot is closed.\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nIn interactive mode, pyplot functions automatically draw\nto the screen.\n\nWhen plotting interactively, if using\nobject method calls in addition to pyplot functions, then\ncall :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw` whenever you want to\nrefresh the plot.\n\nUse non-interactive mode in scripts in which you want to\ngenerate one or more figures and display them before ending\nor generating a new set of figures.  In that case, use\n:func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show` to display the figure(s) and\nto block execution until you have manually destroyed them.\n\n\nPerformance\n===========\n\nWhether exploring data in interactive mode or programmatically\nsaving lots of plots, rendering performance can be a painful\nbottleneck in your pipeline. Matplotlib provides a couple\nways to greatly reduce rendering time at the cost of a slight\nchange (to a settable tolerance) in your plot's appearance.\nThe methods available to reduce rendering time depend on the\ntype of plot that is being created.\n\nLine segment simplification\n---------------------------\n\nFor plots that have line segments (e.g. typical line plots,\noutlines of polygons, etc.), rendering performance can be\ncontrolled by the ``path.simplify`` and\n``path.simplify_threshold`` parameters in your\n``matplotlibrc`` file (see\n:doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing` for\nmore information about the ``matplotlibrc`` file).\nThe ``path.simplify`` parameter is a boolean indicating whether\nor not line segments are simplified at all. The\n``path.simplify_threshold`` parameter controls how much line\nsegments are simplified; higher thresholds result in quicker\nrendering.\n\nThe following script will first display the data without any\nsimplification, and then display the same data with simplification.\nTry interacting with both of them::\n\n  import numpy as np\n  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n  import matplotlib as mpl\n\n  # Setup, and create the data to plot\n  y = np.random.rand(100000)\n  y[50000:] *= 2\n  y[np.logspace(1, np.log10(50000), 400).astype(int)] = -1\n  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify'] = True\n\n  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 0.0\n  plt.plot(y)\n  plt.show()\n\n  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 1.0\n  plt.plot(y)\n  plt.show()\n\nMatplotlib currently defaults to a conservative simplification\nthreshold of ``1/9``. If you want to change your default settings\nto use a different value, you can change your ``matplotlibrc``\nfile.  Alternatively, you could create a new style for\ninteractive plotting (with maximal simplification) and another\nstyle for publication quality plotting (with minimal\nsimplification) and activate them as necessary. See\n:doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing` for\ninstructions on how to perform these actions.\n\nThe simplification works by iteratively merging line segments\ninto a single vector until the next line segment's perpendicular\ndistance to the vector (measured in display-coordinate space)\nis greater than the ``path.simplify_threshold`` parameter.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Changes related to how line segments are simplified were made\n  in version 2.1. Rendering time will still be improved by these\n  parameters prior to 2.1, but rendering time for some kinds of\n  data will be vastly improved in versions 2.1 and greater.</p></div>\n\nMarker simplification\n---------------------\n\nMarkers can also be simplified, albeit less robustly than\nline segments. Marker simplification is only available\nto :class:`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` objects (through the\n``markevery`` property). Wherever\n:class:`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` construction parameters\nare passed through, such as\n:func:`matplotlib.pyplot.plot` and\n:meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`, the ``markevery``\nparameter can be used::\n\n  plt.plot(x, y, markevery=10)\n\nThe markevery argument allows for naive subsampling, or an\nattempt at evenly spaced (along the *x* axis) sampling. See the\n:doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/markevery_demo`\nfor more information.\n\nSplitting lines into smaller chunks\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you are using the Agg backend (see `what-is-a-backend`),\nthen you can make use of the ``agg.path.chunksize`` rc parameter.\nThis allows you to specify a chunk size, and any lines with\ngreater than that many vertices will be split into multiple\nlines, each of which has no more than ``agg.path.chunksize``\nmany vertices. (Unless ``agg.path.chunksize`` is zero, in\nwhich case there is no chunking.) For some kind of data,\nchunking the line up into reasonable sizes can greatly\ndecrease rendering time.\n\nThe following script will first display the data without any\nchunk size restriction, and then display the same data with\na chunk size of 10,000. The difference can best be seen when\nthe figures are large, try maximizing the GUI and then\ninteracting with them::\n\n  import numpy as np\n  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n  import matplotlib as mpl\n  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 1.0\n\n  # Setup, and create the data to plot\n  y = np.random.rand(100000)\n  y[50000:] *= 2\n  y[np.logspace(1, np.log10(50000), 400).astype(int)] = -1\n  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify'] = True\n\n  mpl.rcParams['agg.path.chunksize'] = 0\n  plt.plot(y)\n  plt.show()\n\n  mpl.rcParams['agg.path.chunksize'] = 10000\n  plt.plot(y)\n  plt.show()\n\nLegends\n-------\n\nThe default legend behavior for axes attempts to find the location\nthat covers the fewest data points (``loc='best'``). This can be a\nvery expensive computation if there are lots of data points. In\nthis case, you may want to provide a specific location.\n\nUsing the *fast* style\n----------------------\n\nThe *fast* style can be used to automatically set\nsimplification and chunking parameters to reasonable\nsettings to speed up plotting large amounts of data.\nIt can be used simply by running::\n\n  import matplotlib.style as mplstyle\n  mplstyle.use('fast')\n\nIt is very light weight, so it plays nicely with other\nstyles, just make sure the fast style is applied last\nso that other styles do not overwrite the settings::\n\n  mplstyle.use(['dark_background', 'ggplot', 'fast'])\n\n"
